# Air Alerts in Ukraine

This repository contains machine-readable data from Telegram Channel https://t.me/air_alert_ua.

Its goal is to provide an easy way for data analysis and visualization.

Raw data is received via "export" function of the chat in JSON format and processed via Python (`alerts.ipynb`).

Looking for possibility to automate data extraction step; currently to update the datasets you need to manually download JSON containing whole chat history and run the script.
